# Unity Version Bump

Running this actions checks for updates of upm packages and Unity editor and creates pull requests for each.

## Initial setup

Run `npm install`.

## Running tests

Make sure you've completed the [initial setup](#initial-setup)

Run this command:

```bash
$ npm all

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
  ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ✓ test runs (95ms)

```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try { 
      ...
  } 
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder. 

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket: 

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/ViMaSter/unity-version-bump/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
